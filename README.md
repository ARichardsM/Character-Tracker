# Character Tracker
## Description
Replacement for a previous code, Bond Tracker, a C++ Commandline Script.
The character tracker is used to manage the simple connections between multiple characters and groups of characters, referred to as Units.
## To Do
### Current

### Backlog
- [] More intricate relations
- [] Match the relations between all Characters

- [] On a failed verify, allow the user to automatically refractor all entites
- [] Automatically and randomly change all relations
- [] Fully implement rankings
